## Overview

ROSCA circles are traditional savings groups where members contribute a fixed amount monthly, and each month one member receives the entire pot. Halo Protocol brings this concept to the blockchain with added security, transparency, and programmable rules. With Solend integration, circle funds can earn yield while waiting for distribution.

## Features

- **Configurable Circles**: Set contribution amounts, duration, member limits, and penalty rates
- **Secure Escrows**: All funds are held in Program Derived Accounts (PDAs) 
- **Member Management**: Join circles with stake requirements, track contribution history
- **Monthly Distributions**: Automated pot distribution with tamper-proof records
- **Penalty System**: Built-in penalties for defaulting members
- **Reentrancy Protection**: Secure against common attack vectors
- **üÜï Solend Integration**: Earn yield on circle funds and enable borrowing against staked collateral
- **üÜï Market Yields**: Fetch real-time market data for optimal fund allocation
- **üÜï Lending Services**: Comprehensive deposit, borrow, repay, and withdraw capabilities
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test suite with edge case coverage

## Smart Contract Architecture

### Core Accounts

1. **Circle Account**: Stores circle configuration and state
   - Creator, contribution amount, duration, member limits
   - Current status and monthly contribution tracking
   - Member list and pot distribution history

2. **Member Account**: Individual member data per circle
   - Stake amount and contribution history
   - Status (Active/Defaulted/Exited) and penalties
   - Pot receipt tracking

3. **Circle Escrow**: Secure fund storage
   - Holds all member stakes and contributions
   - Monthly pot allocations
   - PDA-controlled for security

### Key Instructions

- `initialize_circle`: Create a new ROSCA circle
- `join_circle`: Join an existing circle with stake
- `contribute`: Make monthly contribution
- `distribute_pot`: Distribute monthly pot to designated member
- `claim_penalty`: Claim penalties from defaulted members
- `leave_circle`: Exit a circle (with restrictions)

## Architecture Decisions

### Why PDAs?
Program Derived Addresses ensure:
- Deterministic account addresses
- Program-controlled fund custody
- Elimination of signature requirements for escrow operations

### Time-based Operations
The current implementation uses a simplified time calculation. Production versions should implement:
- Solana's Clock sysvar for accurate timestamps
- More sophisticated month calculation logic
- Time zone considerations

### Economic Design
- Stakes discourage defaults and ensure skin in the game
- Penalties provide compensation for disrupted circles
- Configurable parameters allow adaptation to different economic conditions

## Future Enhancements

- **Governance**: Decentralized circle management
- ~~**Insurance**: Optional insurance pools for default protection~~ ‚úÖ **Implemented via Solend integration**
- ~~**Interest**: Yield generation on escrowed funds~~ ‚úÖ **Implemented via Solend integration** 
- **Credit Scoring**: Member reputation system
- **Mobile App**: User-friendly interface
- **Multi-token**: Support for various SPL tokens

## Solend Integration

### Overview
The Halo Protocol now integrates with Solend, Solana's leading lending protocol, to provide yield generation and borrowing capabilities for ROSCA circles.

### Features

#### üè¶ Yield Generation
- **Automatic Deposits**: Circle escrow funds can be automatically deposited into Solend pools to earn yield
- **Market-Rate Returns**: Earn competitive interest rates on idle circle funds
- **Transparent Yields**: Real-time visibility into earned interest for all circle members

#### üí∞ Borrowing Capabilities  
- **Collateralized Loans**: Circle members can borrow against their staked collateral
- **Flexible Terms**: Access to various borrowing options across different token types
- **Efficient Capital**: Make productive use of staked funds while maintaining circle security

#### üìä Market Intelligence
- **Real-Time Data**: Fetch current market yields and lending rates
- **Multi-Asset Support**: Support for USDC, SOL, and other major tokens
- **Optimal Allocation**: Choose the best yield opportunities for circle funds

### Usage

#### Basic Setup
```typescript
import { HaloProtocolClient } from './app/halo-client';
import { Connection } from '@solana/web3.js';

// Initialize client
const connection = new Connection("https://api.devnet.solana.com");
const client = new HaloProtocolClient(program);

// Initialize Solend integration
await client.initializeSolend();
```

#### Deposit Circle Funds for Yield
```typescript
// Deposit circle funds into Solend for yield generation
const signature = await client.depositCircleFundsToSolend(
  circleAccount,
  tokenMint,
  amount,
  escrowTokenAccount,
  circleAuthority
);
```

#### Fetch Market Yields
```typescript
// Get current market data
const yields = await client.getSolendMarketYields();
console.log(`USDC Deposit APY: ${yields.reserves[0].depositApy}%`);
```

#### Member Borrowing
```typescript
// Allow members to borrow against collateral
const signature = await client.borrowFromSolend(
  circleAccount,
  collateralMint,
  borrowMint,
  borrowAmount,
  memberTokenAccount,
  circleAuthority
);
```

### Service Layer

The `SolendService` class provides a clean abstraction over Solend's lending protocol:

- **`depositCircleFunds()`** - Deposit tokens into Solend pools
- **`borrowAgainstCollateral()`** - Borrow tokens using collateral
- **`repayLoan()`** - Repay borrowed amounts
- **`withdrawFunds()`** - Withdraw deposited tokens
- **`fetchMarketYields()`** - Get current market data
- **`getUserPosition()`** - Check user's lending positions

### Examples

Run the Solend integration example:
```bash
npm run example:solend
```

This demonstrates:
- Service initialization
- Market data fetching
- All lending operations (deposit, borrow, repay, withdraw)
- Error handling and edge cases

### Integration Benefits

1. **Enhanced Returns**: Circle funds earn yield instead of sitting idle
2. **Capital Efficiency**: Members can access liquidity against their stakes
3. **Risk Management**: Diversified yield sources reduce overall risk
4. **Transparency**: All operations recorded on-chain with full visibility

### Development & Testing

The integration includes comprehensive test coverage:

```bash
# Run Solend integration tests
npm run test:solend
```

Tests cover:
- Service initialization on devnet
- Market data retrieval
- All lending operations
- Error handling and edge cases
- Mock data validation
