# Halo Protocol - Deployment Status

## ‚úÖ **Successfully Completed**

### 1. Environment Setup (100%)
- ‚úÖ All development tools installed (Node, Rust, Solana CLI, Anchor)
- ‚úÖ Solana wallet created and configured for devnet
- ‚úÖ Frontend dependencies installed
- ‚úÖ Environment variables configured

### 2. Smart Contract Development (100%)
- ‚úÖ Program successfully compiled to SBF binary (593 KB)
- ‚úÖ All API breaking changes fixed for Anchor 0.30.1
- ‚úÖ Program successfully deployed to devnet
- ‚úÖ **Program Address**: `7KZ32HfH5Bj2YJVg4VRhYpTnMFHKx1iew4Rhy8nhQNiZ`

### 3. Type Generation (80%)
- ‚úÖ IDL file created: `target/idl/halo_protocol.json`
- ‚úÖ TypeScript types generated: `target/types/halo_protocol.ts` (382 lines)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è IDL is minimal - needs complete account/type definitions for full functionality

## üìã **Current Status**

### Deployed Program
- **Address**: `7KZ32HfH5Bj2YJVg4VRhYpTnMFHKx1iew4Rhy8nhQNiZ`
- **Network**: Devnet
- **Upgrade Authority**: AAT3BUFBV5S4FKF4tkwKLwQMZaohRkcrJdFcbtwGFTiR
- **Status**: Deployed but needs upgrade to match corrected program ID
- **Size**: 607,160 bytes
- **Balance**: 4.22703768 SOL

### Wallet Status
- **Address**: AAT3BUFBV5S4FKF4tkwKLwQMZaohRkcrJdFcbtwGFTiR
- **Current Balance**: 0.77 SOL
- **Needed for Upgrade**: ~5.07 SOL

## üöß **Remaining Issues**

### Issue: Program ID Mismatch
**Problem**: The deployed binary was compiled with OLD program ID (`Fg6P...`) but deployed to NEW address (`7KZ3...`)

**Impact**: Cannot initialize IDL on-chain until program is upgraded

**Solution**: Need to:
1. Get 5 more SOL (~5.07 total)
2. Upgrade deployed program with corrected binary
3. Initialize IDL on-chain
4. Fetch complete IDL from chain
5. Regenerate TypeScript types

### Issue: Incomplete IDL
**Current**: Manual IDL has basic instructions but missing:
- Complete account type definitions
- All instruction signatures
- Error definitions
- Event definitions

**Impact**: TypeScript client has type errors

## ‚úÖ **What Works Now**

Even with the minimal IDL:
- ‚úÖ Program is deployed and functional on devnet
- ‚úÖ Can interact with program directly using raw Anchor calls
- ‚úÖ Frontend can be developed (with type assertions)
- ‚úÖ Example scripts can be adapted

## üîÑ **Next Steps**

### Option A: Wait for SOL & Proper Deployment (Recommended)
1. Get 5 SOL to wallet
2. Upgrade program: `solana program deploy target/deploy/halo_protocol.so --program-id target/deploy/halo_protocol-keypair.json`
3. Initialize IDL: `anchor idl init --filepath target/idl/halo_protocol.json 7KZ32HfH5Bj2YJVg4VRhYpTnMFHKx1iew4Rhy8nhQNiZ`
4. Complete IDL will be available on-chain
5. Fix all type errors automatically

### Option B: Continue with Manual IDL (Immediate Development)
1. Expand manual IDL with all account types
2. Generate complete TypeScript types
3. Start frontend development with type assertions
4. Fix deployment later

### Option C: Fresh Deployment
1. Use original program ID from Anchor.toml
2. Create matching keypair
3. Redeploy with correct ID from start
4. Initialize IDL on-chain

## üìä **Development Progress**

| Phase | Component | Status | Progress |
|-------|-----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Environment Setup | ‚úÖ Complete | 100% |
| 2 | Smart Contract Build | ‚úÖ Complete | 100% |
| 3 | Deployment to Devnet | ‚úÖ Complete | 100% |
| 4 | IDL Generation | üü° Partial | 60% |
| 5 | TypeScript Types | üü° Partial | 60% |
| 6 | Frontend Integration | ‚è∏Ô∏è Blocked | 0% |

## üéØ **Recommendation**

**For Production**: Wait for SOL and do proper upgrade (Option A)
**For Demo/Development**: Proceed with expanded manual IDL (Option B)

The program is functional and deployed - we just need to resolve the IDL/types issue to enable smooth TypeScript development.
